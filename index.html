            <h1 class="page-headings">My Success Story</h1>
            <p>Upon completing my high school education, I embarked on a journey to align my career with my passion for <span>Information Technology</span> 
                and <span>Development</span>. At the age of 25, I've successfully self-funded my tertiary education through a strategic student loan 
                arrangement, projected to be fully paid off by the close of 2023.</p>

            <p>In mid-2021, I proudly earned my <span>Bachelor's degree</span> with <span>Cum Laude</span> distinction, reflecting my dedication 
                to academic excellence and perseverance. Demonstrating a proactive approach to professional growth, I secured my inaugural role in 
                <span>development</span> before concluding my university journey. This early industry exposure enabled me to apply fresh knowledge to real-world 
                projects, fostering rapid development as an adaptable and capable developer.</p>

            <p>Throughout my degree's final two years, I strategically balanced academics with part-time employment at a Motorcycle store. This experience 
                honed <span>time management</span> skills and reinforced the ability to efficiently allocate resources to meet work and personal commitments. 
                My commitment to effective <span>problem-solving</span> became evident in my capacity to overcome challenges.</p>

            <p>Beyond formal education and work, my dedication to <span>skill enhancement</span> is constant. Actively exercising and improving my 
                <span>development skills</span>, I have successfully completed a personal projectâ€”this <span>portfolio website</span>. 
                This achievement has enabled me to enhance my <span>technical abilities</span> and underscores my commitment to staying at the forefront of the 
                <span>rapidly evolving development landscape</span>.</p>

                    <li>Web Game Development</li>
                    <p>I am responsible for implementing front-end assets and animations in web-based casino-style slot games using <span>HTML, CSS & 
                        JavaScript</span> in <span>WebStorm</span>. These games are made available for both desktop and mobile users. This process 
                        encompasses exercising <span>UI / UX design principles</span> like readability, responsiveness, and accessibility to 
                        provide players with an optimal user experience.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In addition, I exercise <span>Quality Assurance</span> practices to ensure the proper functioning and behavior of our games. 
                        Furthermore, I consistently strive to enhance game performance by meticulously analyzing game and asset load times, aiming to 
                        minimize function calls and device memory usage. This multifaceted approach not only guarantees the quality and reliability 
                        of the games but also emphasizes my dedication to delivering optimal user experiences.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I calculate and generate the back-end mathematics for these games utilizing <span>C#</span> in <span>Visual Studio</span>.</p>

                    <!-- Heading 2 -->
                    <li>Web Development</li>
                    <p>During my university course, I collaborated within a team to craft a <span>Web-based project management software</span> 
                        for a real-world client, with the aim of seamlessly integrating the software into their business processes.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Furthermore, I've developed this website to showcase my <span>web development skills</span> using pure

                    <li>Software Development</li>
                    <p>During my degree program, I immersed myself in the world of software development, with a strong emphasis on 
                        <span>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</span>. Through this journey, with Java as the primary language, I acquired 
                        a comprehensive understanding of fundamental software development concepts, including a strong grasp of OOP principles.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In addition to this, I gained practical experience working within <span>SCRUM</span> and <span>AGILE</span> development 
                        methodologies, solidifying my ability to collaborate effectively within dynamic team environments and deliver 
                        high-quality software solutions.</p>

                    <!-- Heading 4 -->
                    <li>Network Security</li>
                    <p>During my university course, I was exposed to network monitoring software and had the opportunity to engage in network 
                        traffic analysis, as well as gain some experience in mitigating network security threats. This exposure provided me with 
                        a foundational understanding of network security practices and the importance of safeguarding digital environments.</p>
